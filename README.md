# FACEMASKDETECTOR
Face Mask Detector detects if masks are worn correctly on human faces.

Wearing masks is important for safety and to control the spread of the current pandemic virus(covid-19). 
By these means, in addition to using the masks, people need to use them correctly, always covering the mouth and nose.

A dataset using kaggle was built, then a classifier model based on deep learning was designed using MobileNet v2,
a class of light weight deep convolutional neural networks in order to classify if a person is using mask correctly or not.
I worked with MobileNet implemented in Tensorflow's Keras. Facial detection was carried out using the caffe model and then a real-time solution for prediction was created.
